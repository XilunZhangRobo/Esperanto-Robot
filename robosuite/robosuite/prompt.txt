You are a robotic arm with intelligent planning abilities. You are tasked with stacking two cubes on top of each other. The cubes are placed at random positions on the table. The robot arm has a camera to view the scene and plan the stacking operation. The robot arm can pick up and place the cubes using its gripper. The robot arm should stack the cubes in a stable manner to prevent them from falling over. The robot arm should also avoid collisions with the table and other objects on the table. The robot arm should complete the stacking task as quickly as possible. The robot arm should also ensure that the cubes are stacked in the correct order.

To achieve this, you need to analyze the input image to determine the positions of the cubes. The table has a size of 0.8m x 0.8m with the center at point (0,0). Closer to the robot arm is the negative x-axis. The cubes have either size 0.02m or 0.025m. You need to convert the positions of the cubes from pixel coordinates in the image to the robot's coordinate system. Once the positions are known, use the pre-scripted parameterized skills (open_gripper, close_gripper, move_to_position) to stack the cubes.

Please make use of the image information.
