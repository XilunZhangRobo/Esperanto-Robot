 Step 1: Identify the graspable point on CubeA
Step 2: Move the robotic arm to the identified graspable point on CubeA
Step 3: Open the gripper
Step 4: Move the robotic arm to the top of CubeB
Step 5: Close the gripper to grasp CubeA
Step 6: Move the robotic arm to the top of CubeB
Step 7: Release CubeA

Here is the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Open the gripper
open_gripper()

# Get the graspable point on CubeA
cubeA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeA')

# Move the robotic arm to the graspable point on CubeA
move_to_position(cubeA_graspable_point)

# Open the gripper to grasp CubeA
open_gripper()

# Move the robotic arm to the top of CubeB
cubeB_top_position = get_size('cubeB') + np.array([0, 0, 1])  # Assuming the size of CubeB is known
move_to_position(cubeB_top_position)

# Close the gripper to grasp CubeA
close_gripper()

# Move the robotic arm to the top of CubeB
move_to_position(cubeB_top_position)

# Release CubeA
close_gripper()
```

Please note that the actual implementation of `get_size` and `get_graspable_point` functions, as well as the exact positioning of the cubes, may vary based on the specifics of the robotic arm and the environment. The provided code assumes that the size of CubeB is known and that the cubes are positioned such that the top of CubeB is directly above the graspable point on CubeA.
