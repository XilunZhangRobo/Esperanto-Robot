 Step 1: Identify the graspable point on cubeA and cubeB
Step 2: Move the robotic arm to the graspable point on cubeA
Step 3: Open the gripper
Step 4: Move the robotic arm to the graspable point on cubeB
Step 5: Close the gripper to stack cubeA on top of cubeB

Here is the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Open the gripper
open_gripper()

# Get the graspable point on cubeA
cubeA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeA')

# Move the robotic arm to the graspable point on cubeA
move_to_position(cubeA_graspable_point)

# Open the gripper
open_gripper()

# Get the graspable point on cubeB
cubeB_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeB')

# Move the robotic arm to the graspable point on cubeB
move_to_position(cubeB_graspable_point)

# Close the gripper to stack cubeA on top of cubeB
close_gripper()
```
This code follows the steps outlined above to successfully stack cubeA on top of cubeB. The robotic arm first opens its gripper, moves to the graspable point on cubeA, opens its gripper again, moves to the graspable point on cubeB, and finally closes its gripper to stack cubeA on top of cubeB.
