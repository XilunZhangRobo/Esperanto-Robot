 Step 1: Identify the graspable point on cubeA and the position where cubeA should be placed on cubeB.
Step 2: Move the robotic arm to the graspable point on cubeA.
Step 3: Open the gripper to pick up cubeA.
Step 4: Move the robotic arm to the position on cubeB where cubeA should be placed.
Step 5: Close the gripper to place cubeA on cubeB.

Here is the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Open the gripper
open_gripper()

# Get the graspable point on cubeA
cubeA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeA')

# Move the robotic arm to the graspable point on cubeA
move_to_position(cubeA_graspable_point)

# Open the gripper to pick up cubeA
open_gripper()

# Get the position on cubeB where cubeA should be placed
cubeB_position = get_position('cubeB')

# Move the robotic arm to the position on cubeB
move_to_position(cubeB_position)

# Close the gripper to place cubeA on cubeB
close_gripper()
```

Note: The function `get_position('cubeB')` is assumed to return the position where cubeB is located. The actual implementation of this function would depend on the specifics of the environment and the robotic arm's capabilities.
