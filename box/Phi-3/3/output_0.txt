 Step 1: Identify the graspable points on cubeA and ballA.
Step 2: Determine the size of cubeA and ballA to ensure the gripper can hold them.
Step 3: Move the gripper to the top-most graspable point on cubeA.
Step 4: Close the gripper to secure cubeA.
Step 5: Move the gripper to the top-most graspable point on ballA.
Step 6: Close the gripper to secure ballA.
Step 7: Move the gripper to the position where cubeA and ballA will be stacked on cubeB.
Step 8: Open the gripper to release cubeA and ballA onto cubeB.

Here is the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Open the gripper
open_gripper()

# Get the graspable point of cubeA
cubeA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeA')

# Move to the top-most graspable point on cubeA
move_to_position(cubeA_graspable_point)

# Close the gripper to secure cubeA
close_gripper()

# Get the graspable point of ballA
ballA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('ballA')

# Move to the top-most graspable point on ballA
move_to_position(ballA_graspable_point)

# Close the gripper to secure ballA
close_gripper()

# Get the graspable point of cubeB
cubeB_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeB')

# Move to the position where cubeA and ballA will be stacked on cubeB
move_to_position(cubeB_graspable_point)

# Open the gripper to release cubeA and ballA onto cubeB
open_gripper()
```
