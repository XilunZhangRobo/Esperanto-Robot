 Step 1: Identify the graspable points of cubeA and ballA.
Step 2: Determine the size of cubeA and ballA to ensure the gripper can hold them.
Step 3: Move the robotic arm to the graspable point of cubeA.
Step 4: Open the gripper to pick up cubeA.
Step 5: Move the robotic arm to the graspable point of ballA.
Step 6: Close the gripper to pick up ballA.
Step 7: Move the robotic arm to position cueB.
Step 8: Open the gripper to release cubeA.
Step 9: Close the gripper to release ballA.

Here is the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Open the gripper
open_gripper()

# Get the graspable point of cubeA
cubeA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeA')

# Move to the graspable point of cubeA
move_to_position(cubeA_graspable_point)

# Close the gripper to pick up cubeA
close_gripper()

# Get the graspable point of ballA
ballA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('ballA')

# Move to the graspable point of ballA
move_to_position(ballA_graspable_point)

# Open the gripper to release cubeA
open_gripper()

# Close the gripper to release ballA
close_gripper()

# Move to position cueB
move_to_position('cueB')
```
Note: This code assumes that the robotic arm can handle the size of cubeA and ballA and that the graspable points are accessible. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual robotic arm's capabilities and the objects' sizes.
