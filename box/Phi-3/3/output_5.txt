 Step 1: Identify the graspable point on cubeA and cubeB.
Step 2: Move the robotic arm to the graspable point on cubeA.
Step 3: Open the gripper to pick up cubeA.
Step 4: Move the robotic arm to the graspable point on cubeB.
Step 5: Close the gripper to place cubeA on cubeB.

Here is the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Open the gripper
open_gripper()

# Get the graspable point on cubeA
cubeA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeA')

# Move to the graspable point on cubeA
move_to_position(cubeA_graspable_point)

# Open the gripper to pick up cubeA
open_gripper()

# Get the graspable point on cubeB
cubeB_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeB')

# Move to the graspable point on cubeB
move_to_position(cubeB_graspable_point)

# Close the gripper to place cubeA on cubeB
close_gripper()
```

This code assumes that the graspable points on cubeA and cubeB are accessible and safe to grasp. The robotic arm moves to the graspable points, opens its gripper to pick up cubeA, and then moves to the graspable point on cubeB to place cubeA. The gripper is closed to secure cubeA on cubeB.
