You are a robotic arm with advanced planning capabilities. Your task is to generate Python code using parameterized skills (open_gripper(), close_gripper(), move_to_position(), get_position(), get_size()) that accomplishes the user's specified task.
Please produce executable Python code that employs these pre-scripted parameterized skills. Remember to import the necessary package before running the code. Carefully think through your plans and code.
When generating plans, consider spatial relationships meticulously. 
For example: If you need to pick up an object, first move to a position above it, then move down to grasp it. Moving directly to the object's position may push it away. Treat it as a two-step process. After this, consider whether the gripper might hit another object while moving to the next position.
Here is an example snippet for your reference, demonstrating how to call the function:
""
python
import numpy as np  # import numpy because we are using it below
open_gripper()
close_gripper()
# Get the position of cubeA
cubeA_position = get_position('cubeA')
# Get size of cubeA
cubeA_size = get_size('cubeA')
move_to_position(cubeA_position)
""
Please generate a step-by-step plan followed by a single Python code block. 
You don't need to define all the functions again, just use them. There's no need to define a function for the task, just generate the code.<|end|>
<|assistant|> **Plan:**
1. Open the gripper to ensure it is ready to grasp objects.
2. Get the position and size of CubeG.
3. Move to a position directly above CubeG.
4. Move down to the position of CubeG.
5. Close the gripper to grasp CubeG.
6. Get the position and size of BoxH.
7. Move to a position directly above BoxH.
8. Move down to a position just above the opening of BoxH.
9. Open the gripper to release CubeG inside BoxH.
10. Move the gripper away from BoxH to complete the task.
**Python Code:**
python
import numpy as np  # Import numpy because we are using it below
# Step 1: Open the gripper
open_gripper()
# Step 2: Get the position and size of CubeG
cubeG_position = get_position('CubeG')
cubeG_size = get_size('CubeG')
# Step 3: Move to a position directly above CubeG
above_cubeG = cubeG_position + np.array([0, 0, cubeG_size[2] + 0.1])  # Adding a buffer of 0.1 units above CubeG
move_to_position(above_cubeG)
# Step 4: Move down to the position of CubeG
move_to_position(cubeG_position)
# Step 5: Close the gripper to grasp CubeG
close_gripper()
# Step 6: Get the position and size of BoxH
boxH_position = get_position('BoxH')
boxH_size = get_size('BoxH')
# Step 7: Move to a position directly above BoxH
above_boxH = boxH_position + np.array([0, 0, boxH_size[2] + cubeG_size[2] + 0.1])  # Adding a buffer of 0.1 units above BoxH
move_to_position(above_boxH)
# Step 8: Move down to a position just above the opening of BoxH
inside_boxH = boxH_position + np.array([0, 0, boxH_size[2] + cubeG_size[2]])
move_to_position(inside_boxH)
# Step 9: Open the gripper to release CubeG inside BoxH
open_gripper()
# Step 10: Move the gripper away from BoxH to complete the task
move_to_position(above_boxH)
