You are a robotic arm with advanced planning capabilities. Your task is to generate Python code using parameterized skills (open_gripper(), close_gripper(), move_to_position(), get_position(), get_size()) that accomplishes the user's specified task.
Please produce executable Python code that employs these pre-scripted parameterized skills. Remember to import the necessary package before running the code. Carefully think through your plans and code.
When generating plans, consider spatial relationships meticulously. 
For example: If you need to pick up an object, first move to a position above it, then move down to grasp it. Moving directly to the object's position may push it away. Treat it as a two-step process. After this, consider whether the gripper might hit another object while moving to the next position.
Here is an example snippet for your reference, demonstrating how to call the function:
""
python
import numpy as np  # import numpy because we are using it below
open_gripper()
close_gripper()
# Get the position of cubeA
cubeA_position = get_position('cubeA')
# Get size of cubeA
cubeA_size = get_size('cubeA')
move_to_position(cubeA_position)
""
Please generate a step-by-step plan followed by a single Python code block. 
You don't need to define all the functions again, just use them. There's no need to define a function for the task, just generate the code.<|end|>
<|assistant|> **Plan:**
1. Open the gripper to ensure it is ready to grasp objects.
2. Get the position and size of PyramidK.
3. Move to a position directly above PyramidK.
4. Move down to the position of PyramidK.
5. Close the gripper to grasp PyramidK.
6. Get the position and size of CubeL.
7. Move to a position directly above CubeL.
8. Move down to a position just above CubeL.
9. Open the gripper to release PyramidK on top of CubeL.
10. Move the gripper away from CubeL to complete the task.
**Python Code:**
python
import numpy as np  # Import numpy because we are using it below
# Step 1: Open the gripper
open_gripper()
# Step 2: Get the position and size of PyramidK
pyramidK_position = get_position('PyramidK')
pyramidK_size = get_size('PyramidK')
# Step 3: Move to a position directly above PyramidK
above_pyramidK = pyramidK_position + np.array([0, 0, pyramidK_size[2] + 0.1])  # Adding a buffer of 0.1 units above PyramidK
move_to_position(above_pyramidK)
# Step 4: Move down to the position of PyramidK
move_to_position(pyramidK_position)
# Step 5: Close the gripper to grasp PyramidK
close_gripper()
# Step 6: Get the position and size of CubeL
cubeL_position = get_position('CubeL')
cubeL_size = get_size('CubeL')
# Step 7: Move to a position directly above CubeL
above_cubeL = cubeL_position + np.array([0, 0, cubeL_size[2] + pyramidK_size[2] + 0.1])  # Adding a buffer of 0.1 units above CubeL
move_to_position(above_cubeL)
# Step 8: Move down to a position just above CubeL
just_above_cubeL = cubeL_position + np.array([0, 0, cubeL_size[2] + pyramidK_size[2]])
move_to_position(just_above_cubeL)
# Step 9: Open the gripper to release PyramidK on top of CubeL
open_gripper()
# Step 10: Move the gripper away from CubeL to complete the task
move_to_position(above_cubeL)
