Task is place CubeC on top of CubeD and then place CubeE next to CubeC

You are a robotic arm with advanced planning capabilities. Your task is to generate Python code using parameterized skills (open_gripper(), close_gripper(), move_to_position(), get_position(), get_size()) that accomplishes the user's specified task.
Please produce executable Python code that employs these pre-scripted parameterized skills. Remember to import the necessary package before running the code. Carefully think through your plans and code.
When generating plans, consider spatial relationships meticulously.
For example: If you need to pick up an object, first move to a position above it, then move down to grasp it. Moving directly to the object's position may push it away. Treat it as a two-step process. After this, consider whether the gripper might hit another object while moving to the next position.
Here is an example snippet for your reference, demonstrating how to call the function:
"""
python
import numpy as np  # import numpy because we are using it below
open_gripper()
close_gripper()
# Get the position of cubeA
cubeA_position = get_position('cubeA')
# Get size of cubeA
cubeA_size = get_size('cubeA')
move_to_position(cubeA_position)
"""
Please generate a step-by-step plan followed by a single Python code block.
You don't need to define all the functions again, just use them. There's no need to define a function for the task, just generate the code.

<|assistant|> **Plan:**
1. Open the gripper to ensure it is ready to grasp objects.
2. Get the position and size of CubeC.
3. Move to a position directly above CubeC.
4. Move down to the position of CubeC.
5. Close the gripper to grasp CubeC.
6. Get the position and size of CubeD.
7. Move to a position directly above CubeD.
8. Move down to a position just above CubeD.
9. Open the gripper to place CubeC on top of CubeD.
10. Move the gripper away from CubeD to complete the placement.
11. Get the position and size of CubeE.
12. Move to a position directly above CubeC.
13. Move down to a position just above CubeC.
14. Close the gripper to grasp CubeE.
15. Move the gripper down to place CubeE next to CubeC.
16. Open the gripper to release CubeE.
17. Move the gripper away from CubeC to complete the task.
**Python Code:**
python
import numpy as np  # Import numpy because we are using it below
# Step 1: Open the gripper
open_gripper()
# Step 2: Get the position and size of CubeC
cubeC_position = get_position('CubeC')
cubeC_size = get_size('CubeC')
# Step 3: Move to a position directly above CubeC
above_cubeC = cubeC_position + np.array([0, 0, cubeC_size[2] + 0.1])  # Adding a buffer of 0.1 units above CubeC
move_to_position(above_cubeC)
# Step 4: Move down to the position of CubeC
move_to_position(cubeC_position)
# Step 5: Close the gripper to grasp CubeC
close_gripper()
# Step 6: Get the position and size of CubeD
cubeD_position = get_position('CubeD')
cubeD_size = get_size('CubeD')
# Step 7: Move to a position directly above CubeD
above_cubeD = cubeD_position + np.array([0, 0, cubeD_size[2] + cubeC_size[2] + 0.1])  # Adding a buffer of 0.1 units above CubeD
move_to_position(above_cubeD)
# Step 8: Move down to a position just above CubeD
just_above_cubeD = cubeD_position + np.array([0, 0, cubeD_size[2] + cubeC_size[2]])
move_to_position(just_above_cubeD)
# Step 9: Open the gripper to place CubeC on top of CubeD
open_gripper()
# Step 10: Move the gripper away from CubeD to complete the placement
move_to_position(above_cubeD)
# Step 11: Get the position and size of CubeE
cubeE_position = get_position('CubeE')
cubeE_size = get_size('CubeE')
# Step 12: Move to a position directly above CubeC
above_cubeC_next_to_cubeE = cubeC_position + np.array([0, 0, cubeC_size[2] + cubeE_size[2] + 0.1])  # Adding a buffer of 0.1 units above CubeC
move_to_position(above_cubeC_next_to_cubeE)
# Step 13: Move down to a position just above CubeC
just_above_cubeC_next_to_cubeE = cubeC_position + np.array([0, 0, cubeC_size[2] + cubeE_size[2]])
move_to_position(just_above_cubeC_next_to_cubeE)
# Step 14: Close the gripper to grasp CubeE
close_gripper()
# Step 15: Move the gripper down to place CubeE next to Cube
