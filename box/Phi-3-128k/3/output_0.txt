 Step 1: Import the necessary package.
Step 2: Open the gripper to prepare for picking up the objects.
Step 3: Determine the graspable point of "cubeA".
Step 4: Move the gripper to the graspable point of "cubeA".
Step 5: Close the gripper to grasp "cubeA".
Step 6: Move the gripper to the position of "cubeB".
Step 7: Open the gripper to release "cubeA".
Step 8: Repeat steps 3 to 7 for "ballA".

Here is the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np  # import numpy for spatial calculations

# Open the gripper
open_gripper()

# Get the graspable point of cubeA
cubeA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeA')

# Move to the graspable point of cubeA and close the gripper to grasp it
move_to_position(cubeA_graspable_point)
close_gripper()

# Move to the position of cubeB and open the gripper to release cubeA
cubeB_position = get_position('cubeB')  # Assuming a function to get the position of cubeB
move_to_position(cubeB_position)
open_gripper()

# Now, repeat the process for ballA
ballA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('ballA')
move_to_position(ballA_graspable_point)
close_gripper()

# Move to the position of cubeB and open the gripper to release ballA
move_to_position(cubeB_position)  # Assuming the position of cubeB doesn't change
open_gripper()
```

Note: This code assumes that the position of "cubeB" doesn't change after "cubeA" is picked up. If "cubeB" can move, you would need to re-evaluate its position each time before moving to it.
