 Step 1: Identify the graspable point on cubeA.
Step 2: Move the robotic arm's gripper to the identified graspable point on cubeA.
Step 3: Close the gripper to securely grasp cubeA.
Step 4: Move the robotic arm to the position of cubeB.
Step 5: Open the gripper to release cubeA.
Step 6: Repeat the process to ensure cubeA is correctly stacked on top of cubeB.

Here is the corresponding Python code:

```python
import numpy as np  # import numpy for spatial calculations

# Step 1 & 2: Identify the graspable point on cubeA and move to it
cubeA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeA')
move_to_position(cubeA_graspable_point)
open_gripper()

# Step 3: Close the gripper to grasp cubeA
close_gripper()

# Step 4: Move the robotic arm to the position of cubeB
cubeB_position = get_position('cubeB')  # Assuming get_position() is a function to get the position of cubeB
move_to_position(cubeB_position)

# Step 5: Open the gripper to release cubeA
open_gripper()

# Step 6: Repeat the process to ensure cubeA is correctly stacked on top of cubeB
# This step might involve additional logic to check the stacking condition and repeat if necessary
```

Note: The function `get_position('cubeB')` is assumed to be a function that returns the position of cubeB. If such a function does not exist, you might need to implement it based on your specific environment and requirements.
