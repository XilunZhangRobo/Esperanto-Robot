Task is stack both "cubeA" and "ballA" on "cubeB". You need to keep it as stable as possible.

You are a robotic arm with intelligent planning abilities. You task would be generating the python code with parameterized skills (open_gripper(), close_gripper(), move_to_position(), get_graspable_point(), get_size()) that achieves the results provided by the user.
Please generate executable python code that uses given pre-scripted parameterized skills. Please also remember you need to import corresponding package first before you run the code. Think carefully about your plans and code.
When you generate plans, you should think about the spatial relation more carefully. 
For example: You are trying to grab an object. Answer: Your plan should be move to top of it first, and then move down to grasp it. If you directly move to that position, the gripper might push the object away. Think of it as a two step process. After the process, You need to think about whether the gripper would hit the object while its moving to next position.
Here is an example code pieces that you could refer to, which shows how you call the function: 
""
python
import numpy as np  # import numpy because we are using it below

open_gripper()
close_gripper()
# Get the graspable point of cubeA
cubeA_graspable_point = get_graspable_point('cubeA')

# Get size of cubeA
cubeA_size = get_size('cubeA')

move_to_position(cubeA_graspable_point)
""

Please generate step by step plans followed by one python code block.
You do not need to define all the functions again, just use them. Do not need to define function for the task, just generate the code is good.
